# Handwritten Digit Prediction - Convolutional Neural Network

## Project Summary

## Python Libraries Used & How to Install Them

## How to Run the Handwritten Digit CNN

## How to Run with Docker
 When running the docker container, the following command should be used:
 docker build -t enderwolfc/demo:3 .
 docker run -p 8889:8888 enderwolfc/demo:3
 After running the command, the following link should be used to access the jupyter notebook:
 http://localhost:8889/notebooks/HDP_CNN.ipynb
 After following the link Look in the terminal for something that looks similar to this:
 http://f84bb34706cd:8888/tree?token=419b6a8224748f9b4bde95ca6ac75c3e603099237e92bfd0
 Copy the token(everything that comes after token=) and paste it into the password field on the jupyter notebook page. This should lead you to and give you access to the jupyter notebook.
 To compose the docker using the docker-compose.yml file, the following command should be used:
    docker compose up
